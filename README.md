# Game-Engines-Assignment-1---100750922

My game project will be a simple platformer game, where the player has to jump to different platforms in order to reach the end. To ensure this game is within scope for this assignment I'm making it with minimal features in mind. The features included in this game will be player movement (with WASD), jumping (with spacebar), collision, gravity and some animated color changing textures/materials.
